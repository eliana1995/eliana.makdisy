            <p>I proudly graduated as a Web Developer from EC Utbildning in Halmstad in 2024, completing the program in under two years. Throughout this intensive course, 
                I gained comprehensive skills in various aspects of web development, including:</p>
            <p>Front-End Development: I learned to create engaging user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My training included responsive design principles and frameworks like Bootstrap to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

                Back-End Development: I acquired knowledge in server-side programming and database management, utilizing technologies such as PHP, Node.js, and SQL. This foundation allows me to build robust applications that handle data efficiently.
                
                Version Control and Collaboration: I became proficient in using Git and GitHub for version control, enabling effective collaboration in team projects and ensuring smooth workflow management.
                
                Problem-Solving and Project Management: The program emphasized practical experience through hands-on projects, helping me develop strong problem-solving skills and the ability to manage time effectively while working under deadlines.</p>
